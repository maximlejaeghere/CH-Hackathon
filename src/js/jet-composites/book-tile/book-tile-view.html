              <div class="demo-popup-content">
               <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this 
                  continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the 
                  proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
      
               <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
                  or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
                  met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a 
                  portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here 
                  gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether 
                  fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
      
               <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate 
                  -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The 
                  brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it,
                  far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little 
                  note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget 
                  what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be 
                  dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here 
                  have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here 
                  dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these 
                  honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
                  they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly 
                  resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this 
                  nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that 
                  government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not 
                  perish from the earth.</p>
      
               Abraham Lincoln<br/>
